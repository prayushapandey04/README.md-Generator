# README.md Generator

## Description

This project is README.md generator which generates a ReadMe file based on the user's input in their own command line terminal. This project does not use any HTML or CSS and is pure JavaScript and Node.js. This project was given to me with a sample code and I had to add the functionality in order to create a README generator. It takes in the user's input and dynamically creates the ReadMe file for the user.
